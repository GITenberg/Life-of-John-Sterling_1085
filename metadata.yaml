description: Thomas Carlyle undertook this biography of his friend, the British author
  John Sterling (1806 1844), because he was so dissatisfied with an earlier biography
  of Sterling by Julius Charles Hare. Sterling was an ordained curate at Hurstmonceux,
  but retired and began writing. His highest literary achievements were the articles
  he published in Blackwood's Magazine such as, The Onyx Ring and The Palace of Morgana.
  Carlyle's biography has since become a classic and is studied more as a work of
  Carlyle than the life of Sterling.
